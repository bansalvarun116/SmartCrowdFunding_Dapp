# SmartCrowdFunding_dapp

This is a decentralised app for crowdfunding. I call it smart crowdfunding because the money raised through this dapp can not be used without the approval of the shareholders. This provide more safety and securety against misuse of funds 

My main concern with this dapp was to learn to develop , test and deploy smart contracts 
And also use the components of smart contract in my application  

It has a very basic front end (which is also kind of underdeveloped). I welcome you to explore and develop it .
